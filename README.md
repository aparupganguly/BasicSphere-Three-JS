# THREE.js Starter Project

Welcome to the THREE.js Starter Project! This is a basic setup designed to get you up and running with THREE.js, a powerful and flexible 3D library for creating interactive 3D experiences directly in your browser.

## 🎨 Project Overview

This starter project includes:

- **Basic Sphere**: A simple 3D sphere rendered with Standard Mesh material.
- **Icosaherdon Geometry**: A more complex polyhedral geometry, providing a different shape and structure.
- **Wireframe Mode**: Easily toggle between solid and wireframe views to see the underlying structure of the geometry.
- **Camera Setup**: A pre-configured camera to view your 3D objects from a dynamic perspective.
- **Hemisphere Lighting**: Ambient lighting for realistic shading and depth.
- **Orbit Controls**: Smooth, intuitive controls for rotating, zooming, and panning the camera around the scene.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To start using this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/threejs-starter-project.git

   ```

2. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. **Open your browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the scene in action.

## 🚀 Features

- **Customizable**: Easily modify the geometry, materials, and lighting to fit your project needs.
- **Responsive**: Works well on various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **Modular**: Clean, well-organized code structure for easy expansion and integration with other projects.
